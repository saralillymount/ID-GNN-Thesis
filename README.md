## 🧭 Project Overview

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized learning on graph-structured data but often fall short in capturing fine-grained structural identity. This project introduces **ID-GNN**, a new GNN variant that improves structural awareness by encoding node identity directly into the message-passing process.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Improve expressive power of GNNs for structural tasks
- Benchmark against standard GNN architectures
- Demonstrate real-world applicability in classification

## 🧪 Key Features

- 🔁 **ID-aware Message Passing**: Encodes ego-node identity at each step
- 🧪 **Benchmarking**: Extensive evaluation on node classification tasks
- 📈 **Performance**: Achieves within 3% classification accuracy in structural tasks of traditional GNNs

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10**
- **PyTorch**
- **PyTorch Geometric**

- **NetworkX**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- Jupyter Notebooks for visualization and exploratory testing
